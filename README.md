# Polymorphism
<h2>Description</h2>
 The application is used to calculate the moments of inertia of several typical elementary solids (sphere, circular plate, cone, cylinder, circular tube, cuboid).
</br></br>
<p>
Classes modeling individual solids are defined in the form of a hierarchy built using the inheritance technique. One common abstract base class was created and the mechanism of polymorphic method calling was used in order to easily expand the application with new solids.
</p>
